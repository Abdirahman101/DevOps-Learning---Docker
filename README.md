# Docker Learning Journey 🚢🐳

Welcome to my **Docker Learning Journey** repository!  
This repo is used for:

- **Learning the basics of Docker**
- **Hands-on examples to practice**
- **A mini project to apply what I’ve learned**

---

## Why this repo?

I created this repository to **track and structure my Docker learning**, ensuring I build a solid foundation before using Docker in real projects. This will help me:

✅ Build muscle memory with Docker CLI and concepts  
✅ Practice by containerizing simple applications  
✅ Apply concepts through a mini project
